Abridged version control system (Git)

- Throughout this project, I implemented a version control system in Java emulating the features of Git <br />
- My code supports nearly 20 commands, including add, commit, checkout, branch, merge, and log <br />
- Skills used: file persistance, SHA-1 cryptographic hasing, graph traversals, and various Java libraris such as HashMaps, Arrays, Serializable, JUnit testing and Collections.  <br />
 <br />
- If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at varun.kandula@berkeley.edu and I can walk you through the project.
